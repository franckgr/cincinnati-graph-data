message: |-
  The 4.12.12 release only resolves an installation issue https://issues.redhat.com//browse/OCPBUGS-11662 , which does not affect already running clusters. 4.12.12 does not include fixes delivered in recent 4.11.z and 4.12.z releases and therefore upgrading from these versions would cause fixed bugs to reappear. Red Hat does not recommend upgrading clusters to 4.12.12 version for this reason.
