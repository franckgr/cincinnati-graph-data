# 4.3.11 container images were built multi-arch, but we have not started releasing multi-arch images for 4.3.x yet.
# Hence the images are rebuilt as 4.3.12. However 4.3.12 release image does not have metadata to update from 4.3.11.
# 4.3.11 is only released in candidate-4.3 so we should stop edges to it as there are no outgoing edges available for now.
