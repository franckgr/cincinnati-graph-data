# We want folks to pick up 4.13.19's https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OCPBUGS-19472 to avoid being surprised by SecurityContextConstraint stomping
# Also AzureDefaultVMType and AWSECRLegacyCredProvider, but we cannot declare that as a conditional risk from 4.13.19 to 4.14.0 because of https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OTA-1043
